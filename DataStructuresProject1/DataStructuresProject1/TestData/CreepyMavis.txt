Katy Giantbulb looked at the solid knife in her hands and felt delighted.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her noisy surroundings. She had always loved urban Camborne with its uncooked, unusual umbrellas. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel delighted.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Mavis Parkes. Mavis was a creepy queen with wobbly eyes and brunette eyebrows.

Katy gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a lovable, intuitive, beer drinker with pointy eyes and moist eyebrows. Her friends saw her as a regurgitated, ripe rover. Once, she had even revived a dying, injured bird.

But not even a lovable person who had once revived a dying, injured bird, was prepared for what Mavis had in store today.

The drizzle rained like bouncing frogs, making Katy angry.

As Katy stepped outside and Mavis came closer, she could see the flat glint in her eye.

Mavis gazed with the affection of 3560 hungry flat foxes. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want equality."

Katy looked back, even more angry and still fingering the solid knife. "Mavis, you must think I was born yesterday," she replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two horrible, homely humming birds swimming at a very wild Valentine's meal, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two optimistic uncles singing to the beat.

Suddenly, Mavis lunged forward and tried to punch Katy in the face. Quickly, Katy grabbed the solid knife and brought it down on Mavis's skull.

Mavis's wobbly eyes trembled and her brunette eyebrows wobbled. She looked jumpy, her emotions raw like a better, blue-eyed blade.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Mavis Parkes was dead.

Katy Giantbulb went back inside and made herself a nice drink of beer.
