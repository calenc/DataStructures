Josh Snozcumber looked at the peculiar book in his hands and felt sneezy.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. He had always loved industrial Cambridge with its pong, purring parks. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel sneezy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Bob Superhalk. Bob was a brave wally with tall hands and feathery spots.

Josh gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an articulate, sweet, cocoa drinker with grubby hands and handsome spots. His friends saw him as a worried, wandering writer. Once, he had even helped an amused chicken cross the road.

But not even an articulate person who had once helped an amused chicken cross the road, was prepared for what Bob had in store today.

The moon shone like sleeping foxes, making Josh relaxed.

As Josh stepped outside and Bob came closer, he could see the square smile on his face.

"Look Josh," growled Bob, with a malicious glare that reminded Josh of brave kittens. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want some more Facebook friends. You owe me 8259 dollars."

Josh looked back, even more relaxed and still fingering the peculiar book. "Bob, yabba Dabba Doo," he replied.

They looked at each other with worried feelings, like two forgotten, faint foxes partying at a very tight-fisted engagement party, which had trance music playing in the background and two mean uncles boating to the beat.

Suddenly, Bob lunged forward and tried to punch Josh in the face. Quickly, Josh grabbed the peculiar book and brought it down on Bob's skull.

Bob's tall hands trembled and his feathery spots wobbled. He looked stressed, his wallet raw like a sleepy, successful sandwich.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Bob Superhalk was dead.

Josh Snozcumber went back inside and made himself a nice mug of cocoa.
